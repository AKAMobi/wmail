# This is a wrapper for your real ldapsearch.  You would use this ldapsearch
# in order to provide site-specific values, such as timeouts and maximum number
# of hits received.
#
# NOTE: you *must* quote the arguments as shown below -- otherwise you'd
# have a typical security hole on your hands.  Do not alter the quoting
# mechanism.
#
# This example sets the search timeout to 60 seconds, and a maximum of 20
# hits returned.
