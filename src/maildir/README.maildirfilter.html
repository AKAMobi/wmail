<h1>Maildir filter implementation</h1>

<p>Implementing mail filtering requires a couple of dominos to fall in the
right order.  This is not difficult to do, but is a bit tricky.  Here's how it
works, in general.  Specifics follow.</p>

<p>Some people would probably have a difficult time setting it up.  That's to
be expected.  The implementation allows only selected accounts to be set up
for mail filtering, so the suggested way is to attempt to set up mail
filtering for one account only, test it to make sure it works, then roll it
out globally.</p>

<h2>The big picture</h2>

<p>The <i>maildrop</i> mail filter is used to do the actual mail filter. The
first thing you need to do is to download and install <i>maildrop</i>.
Download <i>maildrop</i> from <a
href="http://www.flounder.net/~mrsam/maildrop/">http://www.flounder.net/~mrsam/maildrop/</a>.
Follow the instruction in the <i>maildrop</i> package to configure it and
install it. <i>maildrop</i> must be installed as your mail server's mail
delivery agent. <i>maildrop</i> must be used to deliver mail to the maildir,
obviously, since that's how filtering takes place. You need to follow the
instructions for your mail server in order to install <i>maildrop</i> as the
mail delivery agent.  <i>maildrop</i> must be configured to locate the
recipient's maildir, and dump mail there by default.  Review <i>maildrop</i>'s
and the mail server's documentation.  This can't be any more specific.
Different mail servers are configured in different way.</p>

<p>For example, with Qmail the usual thing to do is to initialize $HOME/.qmail
with "| /usr/local/bin/maildrop". <i>maildrop</i> is also included as part of
the <a href="http://courier.sourceforge.net/" </a>Courier mail server</a>. If
you're running Courier already, you don't need to do actually download and
install <i>maildrop</i>.  You already have everything you need, all you need
to do is to flip the switch that uses <i>maildrop</i> for local mail delivery.
This is done by editing the <code>courierd</code> configuration file (usually
installed in the <code>/usr/lib/courier/etc</code> directory), and setting
<code>DEFAULTDELIVERY</code> according to the instructions in that
configuration file.</p>

<p>The next thing to do is to actually learn how <i>maildrop</i> works, and
learn its filtering language.  Although the mail filter will be automaticaly
generated here, you still need to become familiar with the filtering language
in order to troubleshoot any installation problems. <i>maildrop</i> comes with
manual pages documenting the filtering language, as well as some example. Read
them.</p>

<h2>The little picture</h2>

<p>Here's what's going to happen.  The webmail server will automatically
generate a <i>maildrop</i> filtering recipe.  <i>maildrop</i> reads the
recipe, and does its thing.  Sounds simple enough, right?</p>

<p>Well, it's not.  There are a few little details that need to be
resolved.</p>

<p>For starters, the default <i>maildrop</i> filtering recipe is
<code>$HOME/.mailfilter</code>.  That's how things usually are when actual
physical system accounts are used.  When virtual mailboxes are installed,
things are less murky.  There is no standard way to do virtual mail
arrangement, so the actual implementation varies from system to system.
Somehow or other all or some portion of virtual mailboxes share the same
physical account, and have the same $HOME.  In that case the usual thing to do
is for each virtual mailbox, the corresponding mail filtering recipe is
manually specified to <i>maildrop</i>, as an extra command line argument.
Review the <i>maildrop</i> documentation for more information.</p>

<p>Now, on the other hand, the webmail server doesn't really know anything
about physical and virtual accounts.  The mapping between a login ID and the
maildir is completely encapsulated in a black box-type authentication layer.
The login ID and password are validated by the authentication layer, which
obtains the maildir corresponding to the login ID, and the webmail server is
started for that maildir.  Whether or not a login ID corresponds to an actual
system account or to virtual account, that's something the webmail server
doesn't really know, or care.  All it cares about is the maildir where all the
mail is, and that's the end of the story.</p>

<p>So, the issue is that the webmail server needs to find the corresponding
<i>maildrop</i> filtering recipe, so it knows where to write the mail delivery
instructions.  This is how it works.</p>

<p>In order for mail filtering to be enabled, it is necessary to initialize
the file named <code>maildirfilterconfig</code> in the maildir itself. This is
where the webmail server runs, so it will simply look for the file of this
name.  The contents of this file should be as follows:</p>
<pre>MAILDIRFILTER=<i>pathtomailfilter</i>
MAILDIR=<i>pathtomaildir</i></pre>

<p>The <i>pathtomailfilter</i> specifies the location of the <i>maildrop</i>
filtering recipe for this maildir, relative to the <i>maildir</i> itself. Set
the current directory to the maildir directory, now ask yourself, where's my
<i>maildrop</i> filtering recipe.</p>

<p>In most cases, where virtual mailboxes are not used, everyone's maildir is
<code>$HOME/Maildir</code>, and <i>maildrop</i> uses
<code>$HOME/.mailfilter</code> by default.  In this case,
<i>pathtomailfilter</i> must be set to <code>../.mailfilter</code>.</p>

<p>When virtual mail accounts are used, this will obviously be something else.
The only restriction is that the <i>maildrop</i> filtering recipe and the
maildir <b>must be on the same filesystem or partition</b>.</p>

<p><i>pathtomaildir</i> is the other half of the story.  When <i>maildrop</i>
gets a message to deliver, <i>maildrop</i> needs to know where the mailboxes
and folders are.  <i>Maildrop</i> begins running in what it considers to be
the recipient's home directory, reading either <code>.mailfilter</code>, by
default, or the file specified on the command line.</p>

<p>The webmail server needs to generate filtering instruction that deliver
messages to its maildir.  By default, the maildir for non-virtual accounts is
$HOME/Maildir, so <i>pathtomaildir</i> needs to be set to
<code>./Maildir</code>.</p>

<h2>Summary for virtual accounts</h2>

<p>Basically, 99% of the time <code>MAILDIRFILTER</code> will be
<code>../.mailfilter</code> and <code>MAILDIR</code> will be
<code>./Maildir</code>. When virtual mail accounts are used, <i>maildrop</i>
still must be used as a mail delivery agent, somethow, specifying the correct
maildir that corresponds to the recipient's mail account.  Usually all or most
virtual accounts are set up inside a single physical account.  In that case it
is necessary to set up a different <i>maildrop</i> filtering recipe file for
each virtual mail account (since everyone's <code>$HOME/.mailfilter</code>
will be the same file), and in each maildir specify the relative path to its
corresponding filtering recipe, and the relative path to the maildir from the
default home directory. Then, for each virtual mail account, the mail server
must run <i>maildrop</i> to do the actual mail delivery, explicitly specifying
the filtering recipe to be used.</p>

<h2>The global <code>maildirfilterconfig</code> file</h2>

<p>In most cases where virtual mail accounts are not used, every maildir's
<code>maildirfilterconfig</code> should be the same.  As an alternative to
installing the same <code>maildirfilterconfig</code> in each maildir, it is
possible to install a single <code>maildirfilterconfig</code> systemwide.</p>

<p>For SqWebMail, install <code>maildirfilterconfig</code> in
<code>/usr/local/share/sqwebmail</code> (the default installation directory).
For Courier, install <code>maildirfilterconfig</code> in Courier's
configuration directory (<code>/usr/lib/courier/etc</code> by default).</p>

<p>The global <code>maildirfilterconfig</code> will be used unless
<code>maildirfilterconfig</code> exists in the maildir directory. Therefore,
the global <code>maildirfilterconfig</code> can be used to provide a default
for the majority of the mail accounts, and any exceptions are handled by
installing <code>maildirfilterconfig</code> in the maildir directory, whose
contents will override the global file.</p>

<h2>Happy filtering.</h2>

<p>If everything is set up correctly, SqWebMail will now display a new link to
a screen where mail filtering rules are defined and installed. A mail filter
consists of a condition, and an action.  A condition is usually based on the
contents of some header, or the message body. Regular expressions are allowed.
Which means that certain special characters must be quoted.  For example, to
search for the string "[announce]" verbatim in the subject header, it must be
entered as "\[announce\]".  Pattern matching, for now, is case-insensitive.
The regular expression syntax uses pretty much the same syntax as Perl.  See
the maildropfilter manual page for more information.</p>

<p>Multiple mail filtering rules can be installed.  Their relative order can
be rearranged by selecting a filtering rule, then selecting either the "Up" or
the "Down" button. It is necessary to select "Save all changes" for any
changes to the filtering rules to take effect.  Leaving that page in any other
way will throw away all changes made.</p>

<h2>BUGS</h2>

<p>Known bug:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Create a filter that delivers mail to folder X.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Delete folder X.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>What's going to happen now with mail grabbed by this filter? In the
    current implementation this results with a deferred error.  The message is
    not bounced immediately, but will stay in the queue until the mail server
    times it out. If this condition is caught quickly enough, and the folder
    is recreated, all pent up mail will be redelivered.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>There's some school of thought that says that this should result in mail
    bouncing immediately.  No decision has been made at this point.</li>
