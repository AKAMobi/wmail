   SqWebMail  is  a web CGI client for sending and receiving E-mail using
   Maildir  mailboxes.  SqWebMail  DOES  NOT  support traditional Mailbox
   files, only Maildirs.

   This  is  the  same webmail server that's included in the Courier mail
   server,  but  packaged  independently.  If  you  already  have Courier
   installed, you do not need to download this version.

Features

     * Very lightweight. Reads mail directly from maildirs.
     * Dynamically-generated  HTML is stored in external files. Many (but
       not  all)  display elements can be customized without changing the
       program code.
     * Hierarchical mail folders. Shared folders. (43Kb screenshot)
     * Virtual  accounts - the account database is implemented via a fast
       GDBM  or  DB database lookup. The account database is created from
       plain text files, and some Perl scripts are provided to modify the
       account database from the command line.
     * LDAP authentication.
     * Address book. (36Kb screenshot)
     * Import  E-mail  addresses  from external LDAP address books. (40Kb
       screenshot)
     * vpopmail authentication.
     * Displays HTML messages (optional). (44Kb screenshot)
     * Extensive  MIME  support.  Even  MIME  flowed  text  format, (43Kb
       screenshot)  and  delivery status notifications (41Kb screenshot),
       are recognized and nicely formatted.
     * Javascript and cookies are not required. Most of the functionality
       is  accessible  from  Lynx.  (There  is some Javascript and cookie
       usage for value-added features, such as print preview).
     * Spell  checking  is available, if you have ispell installed. (35Kb
       screenshot)
     * Mail filtering is available, if you have maildrop installed as the
       local mail delivery agent. (47Kb screenshot)
     * Ability to reply to individual messages in a MIME message digest.
     * 8-bit message headers decoded and displayed.
     * Message  dates and times automatically converted to the local time
       zone.
     * Experimental  support  for encryption and digital signatures. This
       is  an  experimental  feature that uses GnuPG to create and manage
       encryption  keys  (45kb  screenshot),  encrypt/sign messages (22kb
       screenshot), and decrypt/verify messages (48kb screenshot).
     * Can  optionally  use  gzip  compression  to  return some large web
       pages, if a modern browser is used that supports gzip compression.

  Calendaring

   Calendaring   services   can  be  optionally  enabled  by  the  system
   administrator.  When  enabled, basic calendar management is available.
   NOTE: this is an experimental beta feature.
     * Recurring events (41kb screenshot).
     * Weekly  (34kb  screenshot)  and monthly (30kb screenshot) calendar
       views.

Demo

   There's  a  demo of SqWebMail available at http://webmail.inter7.com/.
   Use  the  user  id  webmail@webmail.com  and  password webmail. Please
   note:only  one  person  can  access  the  account at the same time. If
   someone  attempts  to log in after you, you will be bumped off with an
   authentication failure (in cases of multiple logins, the oldest one is
   bumped).

Requirements

   SqWebMail  requires  that  either  the  GDBM or the DB library must be
   installed. Perl is also required.

   GNU  make  and  gcc/egcs  is  also highly recommended. There have been
   intermittent  reports  of  various  problems  with  using  other  make
   utilities,  or  other  compilers.  Chances  are  that  everything will
   compile and install properly, though. Currently, some of the component
   libraries include some self-test code written in C++. SqWebMail itself
   is written entirely in C, and the C++ components are not used; however
   you have to be able to compile C++, for now.

INSTALLATION overview

   Read  INSTALL,  SECURITY  and  BUGS  before  compiling  and installing
   SqWebMail.  You  will  install  the sqwebmail program as a setuid root
   binary    in    your    cgi-bin    directory   by   default.   Loading
   http://yourwebsite/cgi-bin/sqwebmail will present the log-on page. You
   can  manually  move  sqwebmail to any other directory, and use any URL
   that resolves to sqwebmail.

  Download

   Download sqwebmail: http://www.courier-mta.org/download.php#sqwebmail

   Semi-regular    CVS    snapshots    are    regularly    uploaded    to
   ftp://courier.sourceforge.net/pub/courier/sqwebmail.

  CVS

   SqWebMail can also be downloaded from an anonymous CVS repository. See
   http://www.courier-mta.org/status.html for more information.

  RPMs

   You  can  build a binary RPM directly from this tarball. Download this
   tarball,  then type rpm -ta filename. RPM 3.0, or higher, is required.
   Use  rpmbuild  -ta  filename  with RPM 4.1, or higher (Red Hat 8.0, or
   higher).

   NOTE: Prior to 0.31 I used to provide the source tarball repackaged as
   a source RPM, and two prebuilt binary RPMs - with and without vpopmail
   support.  I've  upgraded the source tarball so that binary RPMs can be
   built  directly from the tarball. If you have vpopmail, the RPM should
   build  to  include  vpopmail  support,  however  since before 0.31 the
   vpopmail RPM package had a slightly different name, you cannot upgrade
   directly,  and  you  must  uninstall  the  pre-0.31 binary vchkpw RPM,
   install  the  new  one that you just built, then restore any .rpmsaved
   configuration files.

Enhancements

   Note  that some of the following patches may be against older versions
   of   SqWebMail.  Check  the  documentation  in  each  patch  for  more
   information.

   Brian  Cash  <bcash@alpdev.com>  has  a  patch  that  allows different
   virtual domains on the same host to use different HTML templates.

Links

   Chapter  21  in  the  book Postfix talks about configuring the Postfix
   server for SqWebMail.

   It  is  possible  to  translate  HTML  templates  for sqwebmail into a
   foreign  language.  NOTE:  that after a new version of sqwebmail comes
   out  which  includes  any  changes in the HTML templates, it will take
   some  time  for the independent maintainers to update their translated
   versions as well.
