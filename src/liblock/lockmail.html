>DESCRIPTION</H2
><P
><B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>lockmail</B
> is a helper utility for working with mailbox
files.
Mailbox files must be locked to prevent other applications from modifying the
mailbox at the same time.
Different system use different locking conventions.
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>lockmail</B
> uses two of the most common locking mechanisms
in use, which should work reliably on most systems.</P
><P
><TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>lockfile</I
></TT
> is the pathname to an existing mailbox
file.
By default, <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>lockmail</B
> tries to lock the mailbox every
five seconds (if the mailbox is already locked), and will give up after
three minutes.
After the mailbox is succesfully locked, <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>lockmail</B
> runs
<TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>program</I
></TT
> as a child process, with any optional
<TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>argument</I
></TT
>s.
When <TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>program</I
></TT
> terminates, <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>lockmail</B
>
removes the mailbox lock, and terminates itself.</P

<B
CLASS="COMMAND"

<B
CLASS="COMMAND"

order to maximize compatibility with other mail software:
C-Client folder locks, dot-locks, and file locks.</P

>C-Client folder locks</H3
><P
>Mail software based on the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>C-Client</TT
> library creates
lock files named
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/tmp/.<TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>dddddd</I
></TT
>.<TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>iiiiii</I
></TT

>.
Here, <TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>dddddd</I
></TT
> and <TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>iiiiii</I
></TT
>
are the device number and the inode number of the mailbox file
(the <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
><I
>st_dev</I
></TT
> and <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
><I
>st_ino</I
></TT
>
fields in the inode), in hexadecimal.
If the process ID saved in the C-Client folder lock file is not valid,
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>lockmail</B
> concludes that it's a stale lock file, and
will remove it.</P

Dot-lock files are first created as temporary files, then linked to
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
><TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>lockfile</I
></TT
>.lock</TT
>.
The link operation fails if the dot-lock file already exists.
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>lockmail</B
>
uses an enhanced method of dot-locking, where its process ID, and the name
of the server where <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>lockmail</B
> is running is also saved
in its dot-lock file.
If the operation fails due to an existing dot-lock file that was created
by another <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>lockmail</B
> process on the same server, and the
process ID no longer exists, this stale dot-lock file is removed immediately.
In all other situations a dot-lock file older than five minutes is considered
stale, and removed.</P

The incoming mail spool directory (usually
<TT

typically does not have global write permissions, so the attempt to
create the dot-lock file in the spool directory will fail, and
<B
